\begin{abstract}

This paper presents Grouper, a framework for developing mobile applications, which protects user data by storing data in multiple untrusted servers.
Grouper uses a secret sharing scheme to create several shares from a marshalled object and uploads these shares to multiple untrusted servers. 
Our multiple untrusted servers are a self-destruction system.
Uploaded shares will be deleted after a period of time by the Web service running on the multiple untrusted servers.
To transfer data among mobile devices, we design our own \emph{Grouper Message}. 
We have implemented Grouper in the Objective-C language.
We evaluate the developer efforts and the performance of Grouper. 
We have implemented three applications using Grouper: an iOS application Account Book, a macOS application Notes and a benchmark application Test.

\section{Introduction}

Conventional mobile applications are built based on a client-server mode and require the central servers for storing shared data and processing confidential information.
The users of such mobile applications must fully trust the central servers. 
If the central servers can be accessed by an attacker, a curious administrator, or a government, user information will be revealed because data is often stored on the server in cleartext. 
In addition, users may lose their data when service providers shut down their servers.

To address such a problem, Vanish\cite{geambasu2009vanish}, SafeVanish\cite{zeng2010safevanish}, SeDas\cite{zeng2012sedas} and CouldSky\cite{zeng2015cloudsky} use a data self-destruction system as their cloud storage.
In these approaches, servers store data temporarily and delete data after period of time.
Mylar\cite{popa2014building} and Sweets\cite{sweets} use data encryption to protect user data.
These existing approaches have following problems.
Firstly, these existing approaches do not support data recovery when some nodes miss getting data from shared storage.
Application developers have to deal with such cases by themselves.
Further, these approaches do not support developing mobile applications.

To address these problems, we are developing Grouper, a framework for developing mobile applications. 
Grouper provides objects synchronization among mobile devices.
In Grouper, a sender node translates an updated object into shares using a secret sharing scheme and uploads these shares to untrusted servers. 
A receiver node downloads some of these shares and reconstructs the object.
The untrusted servers construct a self-destruction system, and delete these shares after a period of time.
Unlike existing approaches, although Grouper uses the data self-destruction scheme, it support data recovery when some nodes miss getting shares from untrusted servers.
When a receiver node misses getting shares, the Grouper framework automatically asks the sender to upload missing shares again.
Such scheme ensures reliable information sharing among devices of a group.
In addition, data can be recovered even untrusted servers shut down because all devices of group members keep a complete data set of this group.

Grouper consists of a client framework and a Web service.
We have implemented the Grouper framework for iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS in the Objective-C language.
We have implemented the Web service running on the multiple untrusted servers in Java. 
We have embedded the Sync framework in Grouper to synchronize objects among mobile nodes.
We have implemented three applications using Grouper: an iOS application Account Book, a macOS application Notes and a benchmark application Test.
These implementations shows that Grouper makes it easy to develop mobile applications with data synchronization.
Experimental results show that the performance of Grouper is feasible for mobile applications that are used in a small group of people.

The contributions of this paper are as follows.
Firstly, we provide support for data recovery when some nodes miss getting data from untrusted servers.
Grouper realizes reliable data synchronization among nodes using a reliable multicast technique.
Secondly, we make it easier to develop mobile applications.
A developer can add data synchronization functions to an applications with a few lines of code.

\section{Assumption and Threat Model}

In this section, we introduce assumptions and threat model of Grouper.
There are four following basic assumptions underlying the Grouper framework.

Firstly, a server is a passive adversary, and can read all data, but it does not actively attack.
The server hosts Web services and performs device authentication.
Servers generate access keys for group users. 
When a device wants to get/put data from/to untrusted servers, the device sends a request with an access key in the request header.
A node divides data into shared before it is uploaded to the server, and recover the data after downloading using a secret sharing scheme. 
In this paper, we do not address other attack types such as user tracking and metadata collection by servers. 
For example, the server can track users with IP addresses, and Grouper cannot hide social graphs against such tracking.

Secondly, data transportation between a device and an untrusted server is secure.
Grouper improves mobile application security by concentrating on data storage in servers rather than data transportation.
If someone attacks the HTTP connection and gets some shares, he can try to recover these shares and may get the original data.

Thirdly, in an application, all group members are not malicious and their devices connect to each other in a face-to-face distance.
We target applications that are used in a small group, like all members in a small office.
Thus, the group members are persons this office know one another and they are not malicious.
In members inviting, a group owner authenticates group members by a face-to-face way.
Connections for data transportation between two devices only be established in members inviting.
Malicious users outside the group can pretend as the member of the group to get secret information.

At last, a server is isolated from one another and managed by independent providers.
In fact, we hope each untrusted server’s manager does not know the existence of others.
To use applications by grouper, the leader of a small company can assign three different employees to deploy the Web service in different servers secretly. 
This leader must ensure those employees do not collude to crack user data.
For example, a group owner picks up servers of Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, which are supposed not to expose users' data to other cloud providers.
If anyone has privilege to access more than enough untrusted servers to recover the shares to original data, he can get all shared information of a group.

\section{Design}

This section describes the design of the Grouper framework.

\subsection{Overview}

Our goal is to support developing mobile applications that are not relining on trusted central servers.
We target mobile applications that are used in a small group of people.
A group consists of an owner and other members.
Each member has a mobile device.
A owner invites other members in a face-to-face way.

To support developing such mobile applications, we provide the Grouper framework.
This framework provides the following functions:

\begin{itemize}
	\setlength{\itemsep}{1pt}
	\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
	\setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
	\item \textbf{Data Synchronization.} If an user updates an object in his device, the mirrors of this object in other devices are updated.
	\item \textbf{Group management.} A group owner can create a group and invite other members to his group.
\end{itemize}

For example, \emph{Account Book} is an iOS application developed using Grouper. 
In this application, a leader of a small company creates a group and invites employees to the group. 
Then, the employees can record the income and expenditure of this company and share these records to others.
Anyone can edit and delete existing records.

Grouper uses untrusted servers to exchange messages among mobile devices.
Untrusted servers construct a self-destruction system, and delete messages after a period of time.
Grouper protect messages from the providers of untrusted servers using a secret sharing scheme.
Grouper has the following advantages over conventional systems using untrusted servers.
Firstly, it is easy for a developer to recover from message losses in untrusted servers (Section 3.4 and Section 3.5).
Grouper performs retransmission when some mobile devices miss getting messages from untrusted servers.
Developers of mobile applications do not have to specify lifetimes of messages.
Secondly, it is easy for a group owner to invite other members using a safe communication channel in a face-to-face distance (Section 3.6).

\subsection{Comparisons with encryption methods}

Grouper uses the secret sharing scheme to protect user data rather than data encryption methods.
In a secret sharing scheme, a member securely shares a secret with other members by generating $n$ shares using a cryptographic function\cite{smith2013layered}. 
At least $k$ or more shares can reconstruct the secret, but $k-1$ or fewer shares can obtain nothing about the secret\cite{pang2005new}. 
We describe this scheme as a function $f(k, n)$, where $n$ is the number of all shares, and $k$ is the threshold to combine shares. 
If one person outside a group can access to $k$ or more untrusted servers, he has enough shares to recover the original user data.

Compared with data encryption methods, the secret sharing scheme has following features.
Firstly, like data encryption method, using the secret sharing scheme is also secure because a single shares created by it is unreadable for a server manager.
However, using data encryption requires key management including generation and distribution.
Data encryption systems like CloudSky always use trusted authorities for key management.
In Grouper, we require all cloud services are untrusted.
Secondly, the secret sharing scheme ensures the data availability in the situation that a small number of untrusted servers are not accessible.
For the $f(k, n)$ scheme, the original object can be recovered after accessing more than $k$ untrusted servers.
Thirdly, the secret sharing scheme improves the anti-attack ability, because the attacker who can access only $k-1$ or less untrusted servers cannot get any readable informations.
At last, the performance of the secret sharing scheme we used in Grouper is faster than Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) and slower than Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).
For these reasons, using a secret sharing scheme is more suitable for the Grouper framework than using a data encryption method.

\subsection{Architecture}

\begin{figure}[t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{architecture}
	\caption{Architecture of Grouper.}
\end{figure}

Figure 1 describes the architecture of the Grouper framework. 
An application using Grouper consists of the six following layers:

\begin{itemize}
	\setlength{\itemsep}{1pt}
	\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
	\setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
	\item \textbf{Grouper API}
	A developer develops an application without data synchronization at first. 
	He can use the API provided in the client framework of Grouper to add the synchronization function to his application.
	\item \textbf{Synchronization.} 
	Grouper uses the third-party framework for data synchronization.
	This layer marshall an updated object in a persistent store and send it using the lower reliable message layer.
	When this layer receives a message, this layer unmarshall the message, reconstructs an object, and put the object into the persistent store.
	\item \textbf{Reliable Message.}
	This layer provides a reliable message service with multicasting capability among devices.
	The destination of a massage is not only the node identifier (ID) of a single device but also "*", which means delivering to all the other nodes.
	This layer try to deliver a message to other devices even the message is deleted in untrusted servers before some nodes download the message.
	\item \textbf{Unreliable Message.}
	This layer provide an unreliable message service multicasting capability among devices.
	This layer do not ensure the message delivery to other devices.
	\item \textbf{Data Protection.}
	Grouper protects user data by a secret sharing scheme in this layer.
	This layer divides a message into several shares, and uploads these shares to untrusted servers.
	When this layer downloads shares from untrusted servers, it recovers the original message using the secret sharing scheme.
	\item \textbf{Untrusted servers.}
	When a mobile device uploads a share to a server, the server receives it and stores it into a database.
	When a mobile device downloads a share from a server, the server retrieves it from the database and send it into the device.
	An untrusted server performs device authentication using device keys.
\end{itemize}

The following subsections describe details of these layers from the top layer to the bottom layer.

	\end{tabular}
\end{table*}

\subsection{Grouper API}% 3.3

The Grouper framework provides object synchronization among mobile devices throughput a simple API.
A developer can add object synchronization functions to a standalone application with a few lines of code.
Table 1 shows the API of Grouper.
An application initializes the framework by invoking the method grouper.setup().
When the application needs to update an object in all devices, the application invokes the method grouper.sender.update().
When the application needs to delete an object in all devices, the application invokes the method grouper.sender.delete().
The the application uses the method grouper.receiver.receive() to register a callback function.
This callback function is called when another node updates an object and its local mirror has been updated.
The application can use this callback function to change the values that are shown in a user interface screen.
The method grouper.confirm() is used for realizing reliable messaging.
We will describe reliable messaging in Section 3.X.

\subsection{Data Synchronization}

To synchronize data from one device to another device, we consider the following problems:

\begin{itemize}
	\setlength{\itemsep}{1pt}
	\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
	\setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
	\item \textbf{Transportation:}
	How to transport shares from one device to other devices.
	\item \textbf{Synchronization:}
	How to create several shares from an object in a device. 
	How to recover an object from shares and put it into a persistent store.
	\item \textbf{Reliability:}
	How to ensure message delivery even some nodes miss downloading message from untrusted servers in the TTL.
\end{itemize}

We answer these questions and describe data synchronization flow in this section.

\subsubsection{Transportation}

\begin{figure}[t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.42]{sync_flow}
	\caption{Implementing unreliable messaging with untrusted servers and a secret sharing scheme.}
\end{figure}

Figure 2 describes our data transportation flow using multiple untrusted servers. 
At first, the sender adds an object in his device and Grouper creates three shares by a secret sharing scheme. 
Next, Grouper uploads those shares to three untrusted servers. 
In Figure 2, the receiver is online, and he downloads two shares from two servers and recovers the new record. 
In this process, these servers cannot recover user data because they do not have permission to access other untrusted servers. 

To improve the reliability in data transportation, we design our own scheme $f(k, n, r)$ for Grouper based on the basic the Shamir's secret sharing scheme $f(k, n)$.
In the $f(k, n, r)$ scheme, the parameter $k$ and $n$ is same as which in the  $f(k, n)$ scheme. 
The parameter $r$ represents the number of necessary untrusted servers when a sender uploads shares.
Although the receiver is able to recover the original data from the receiver with more than $k$ shares, we should consider a situation that some shares are broken.
Those broken shares may caused by the unstable network connection, the database damage in untrusted servers or malicious attackers.
Consider the situation that there are $n$ untrusted servers. 
When a sender wants to upload shares to multiple untrusted servers, Grouper will try to upload these shares to all untrusted servers at first.
If the shares are uploaded to $r$ or more untrusted servers, we consider share uploading transaction is successful.
Otherwise, Grouper should try to upload these shares again after a period of time.

\subsubsection{Synchronization}

Because we implement our client framework in Objective-C at first, we use the \emph{Sync} framework\cite{sync} for data synchronization.
To assist the Sync framework, we design our own messaging function called \emph{Grouper Message} Protocol (Section 3.4).
Using the Sync framework, we get a JSON string from an updated object, send the JSON to other devices, and update the mirrors of the object in these devices. 

We should consider the confliction problem in data synchronization. Most data sharing applications like Evernote provide a function that user can select an edition by themselves when data is conflicting. However, the Sync framework has not provide such functions by now. The default policy in the Sync framework is using the newest edition. For example, both Alice has modified an object and Bob modified it one hour later. Grouper will receive Bob's modification due to the newest edition policy. 

\subsubsection{Reliability}

\begin{figure}[t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.38]{reliable_sync}
	\caption{Implementing reliable messaging with sequence numbers.}
\end{figure}

Grouper should provide a reliable synchronization service. 
A user in a group creates a new record and all of other members in this group should synchronize this record, even if this record is deleted by untrusted servers after the TTL. 
We call this problem reliable synchronization. 
A receiver can only download shares from untrusted server with the TTL. 
If he is offline within the TTL, he will miss the new record.

To solve this problem, we reference the basic reliable multicasting scheme in distribute systems. 
Messages in this scheme should have sequence number which is added one by one, to indicate the sending order of those messages. 
For example, the sender of a group send a message No.25 and all of the receivers receive the message No.25 successfully. 
When the receivers receive new message No.25, they will compare No.25 with the newest sequence number in their persistent store. 
One of the receivers finds that his newest sequence number is No.23, that means he missed the message No.24. 
Thus, when they send feedback to the receiver, he will report that he missed the message No.24. 
At last, the sender will send the missed message to him.

Based on the basic reliable multicasting scheme, we designed our own protocol to ensure the reliability in data synchronization of Grouper. 
As described in Figure 2, the sender has sent messages from No.1 to No.4. 
Next, he sends sequence numbers of all messages he sent to the receiver. 
When the receiver receives the sequence numbers, he checks his local persistent store. 
In this situation, the receiver finds that he missed the message No.3 and No.4. 
Thus, he will send a resend request that contains the sequence numbers of messages he missed to the sender. 
At last, the sender will send the message No.3 and No.4 again to the receiver again.

\subsection{Grouper Message Protocol}

To transfer data between devices, we design our own protocol, \emph{Grouper Message} Protocol. 
In this protocol, a message is a JSON string that contains an object of an application and the way to handle it in receivers’ devices.
Table 1 shows the attributes in a Grouper message.
We concentrate on three important attributes here.

\begin{itemize}
	\setlength{\itemsep}{1pt}
	\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
	\setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
	\item \textbf{Type.}
	There are 4 types of Grouper messages: update message, delete message, confirm message and resend message. 
	Both update message and delete message need resending because they contain the objects of an application. 
	We call these messages normal messages. 
	Both confirm message and resend message contain control information about reliable multicast and need not resending. 
	We call these messages control messages.
	\item \textbf{Content.} 
	If this message is an update message, content is a JSON string of an object.
	If this message is a delete message, content contains the objectId of an object.
	If this message is a confirm message or a resend, content contains the sequence numbers.
	\item \textbf{Sequence.}
	The sequence number increases one by one in a device.
	Combined with the node identifier, it can indicate an unique Grouper message.
	Thus, it is contained in a confirm message to indicate the all normal messages a device sent or in a resend message to indicate the normal message a device has not been received.
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[t]
	\centering
	\caption{Attributes of Grouper message.}
	\label{my-label}
	\begin{tabular}{lll}
		\hline
		\textbf{Attributes} & \textbf{Type} & \textbf{Explanation} \\ \hline
		type & String & Type of this message. \\
		content & String & JSON string of an object. \\
		messageId & String & Physical ID of this message. \\
		object & String & Object name. \\
		objectId & String & Object physical ID. \\
		receiver & String & Node identifier of the receiver. \\
		sender & String & Node identifier of the sender. \\
		email & String & Email address of the sender. \\
		name & String & Name of the sender. \\
		sendtime & Integer & Unix timestamp of sendtime. \\
		sequence & Integer & Sequence number of this message. \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{algorithm}[t]
	\caption{Handle messages algorithm}\label{alg:euclid}
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]		
		\Procedure{handleMessages}{$msgs$}
		\For{$msg$ \textbf{in} $msgs$} 
		\If{$msg.sender$ not exist}
		\State $saveUser(msg)$
		\EndIf
		\If{$msg.type \in \left \{ "update", "delete" \right \} $}
		\State $sync(message)$
		\ElsIf{$msg.type \in \left \{ "confirm" \right \} $}
		\State $seqs \gets getSeqs(msg.content)$
		\State $seqs \gets removeExisted(seqs)$
		\State $resendMsg(seqs)$
		\ElsIf{$msg.type \in \left \{ "resend" \right \} $}
		\If{$msg.receiver = currentUser$}
		\State $seqs \gets getSeqs(msg.content)$
		\State $sendExistingMsgs(seqs)$
		\EndIf
		\EndIf
		\EndFor
		\EndProcedure
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Developers need to send the update, delete and confirm message using client API of Grouper.
When a user creates a new object or modifies some attributes of an existing object, the device sends an update message that contains the JSON string of this object to all group members.
When a user deletes an existing object, the device sends a delete message that contains the object ID of this object to all group members.
To confirm all devices have received all normal messages (update message and delete message) created by a user, the device sends a confirm message to all devices periodically.
In this confirm message, the sequence number of objects recently created in this device are included.

Algorithm 1 describe the handle process when a device get some messages.
For an update message or a delete message, Grouper invokes the API provided in third-party synchronization framework to get the object into persistent store.
Fo ra confirm message, Grouper gets the sequence numbers from the message content and removes those sequence numbers which is existing in the device.
Then Grouper creates a resend message that contains missing sequence numbers and sends it to the sender of this confirm message.
For a resend messages, Grouper gets the sequence numbers, finds the corresponding normal messages and send them to the sender of this resend message.

\subsection{Group Management}

\subsubsection{Creating a Group}

A user creates a group, and he becomes the owner of this group.  
Before creating a group, the owner prepares his own user information including his email and name, multiple untrusted servers, a group ID and a group name. 
Next, he initializes this group on all untrusted server by submitting his node identifier. 
The node identifier, which represents his device, is generated by Grouper randomly when the application is launched at the first time. 
In each untrusted server, the Web service initializes this new group and returns a master key including the highest privilege to the owner. 
The owner can add other members to an untrusted server by the master key.

\subsubsection{Inviting a Member}

After creating a group, the owner can invite a new member to his group. 
To join the group, the new member prepares his user information at first. 
The owner invites the new member by a face-to-face way rather than using central servers. 
Before inviting, Grouper establishes connection between their devices using local secure links like \emph{Multipeer Connectivity}\cite{mc}. 
Firstly, the new member sends user information and a node identifier to the owner. 
Owner saves the user information and the node identifier of the new member to his device. 
Secondly, the owner registers the new member on multiple untrusted servers by submitting the node identifier of the new member. 
Thirdly, untrusted servers returns access keys for the new member to the owner. 
Lastly, the owner sends the access keys, server addresses and the list of existing members to the new member. 
After receiving them, the new member can access these untrusted servers with the keys.

\section{Implementation}

Grouper consists of a Web service running on multiple untrusted servers and a client framework for developing applications.
We introduce the implementation of the Web service (Section 4.1), the implementation of the client framework (Section 4.2) and demo applications (Section 4.3) in this section.

\subsection{Web Service}

Grouper needs its own Web service rather than using commercial general cloud services like Amazon S3, Google Cloud for the following reasons:

\begin{itemize}
	\setlength{\itemsep}{1pt}
	\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
	\setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
	\item The Web service must provide reliable synchronization based on the \emph{Grouper Message} protocol.
	\item The Web service must ensure that shares are deleted after a prescriptive time.
\end{itemize}

Our Web service provides RESTful API to transfer data with clients. 
It runs on the Tomcat server that is an open source implementation of the Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, Java Expression Language and Java WebSocket technologies. 
We use the Spring MVC, a  Web model-view-controller framework, to create our RESTful API, and Hibernate, an open source Java Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework, to save and operate objects in the Web service. 

Our Web service includes three kinds of entities. 
They are \emph{Group}, \emph{User} and \emph{Transfer} entities. 
A \emph{Group} entity saves a group ID, a group name and its owner. 
A \emph{User} entity saves the node identifier of a user, the access key for this user, and the group entity of this user. 
A \emph{Transfer} entity saves a share generated with a secret sharing scheme, the time when the user uploads the share. 
For each user, there is a unique access key for him in an untrusted server. For a group, one of a user is its owner who has the highest privilege of this group.

\subsection{Client}

Grouper's client framework is developed in Objective-C, and it supports developing applications on iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS.
It is based on the following frameworks.   

\begin{itemize}
	\setlength{\itemsep}{1pt}
	\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
	\setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
	\item 
	\emph{Multipeer Connectivity}\cite{mc},  an official Peer-to-Peer communication framework provided by Apple. 
	Grouper uses it to transfer data between two devices by a face-to-face way.
	\item 
	\emph{Core Data}\cite{coredata}, an official ORM framework provided by Apple.
	\emph{Core Data} provides generalized and automated solutions to common tasks associated with object life cycles and object graph management, including persistence. 
	Grouper uses it to manage model layer objects. 
	\item 
	\emph{Sync}\cite{sync}, a synchronization framework for \emph{Core Data} using JSON. 
	When a user sends messages, Grouper uses it to create JSON strings from objects. 
	When an other user receives messages, Grouper uses it to parse JSON strings and synchronize the recovered objects into \emph{Core Data}.
	\item 
	\emph{c-SSS}\cite{c-sss}, an implementation of the secret sharing scheme.
	\item 
	\emph{AFNetworking}\cite{afnetworking}, a delightful networking library in Objective-C. 
	Grouper uses it to invoke the RESTful API provided by our Web services running on multiple untrusted servers. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Applications}

Using Grouper framework, we are developing the following applications. 

\begin{itemize}
	\setlength{\itemsep}{1pt}
	\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
	\setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
	\item \emph{Account Book}, an iOS application in Objective-C, records the income and expenditure of a group.
	\item \emph{Test}, a benchmark iOS aapplication in Swift, tests the performance of Grouper.
	\item \emph{Notes}, a macOS application in Swift, takes shared notes for a small group.
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation}

This section shows the developer efforts to use Grouper and the performance of Grouper.

\subsection{Developer Efforts}

We see developer efforts through two factors: the usability of the client API and the code size in the lines of code(LoC) the developer has to add after using Grouper. 
As described in Table 2, Grouper provides the simple client APIs for developers.
To extend a stand alone application, developers invoke the \emph{grouper.setup()} to set appId and data stack.
To synchronize data among devices, developers invoke the \emph{grouper.sender.update()}, \emph{grouper.sender.delete()} and \emph{grouper.receiver.receive()} method.
To ensure the data created in a device has been synchronized in other devices, developer invoke the \emph{grouper.confirm} method.

We have developed two applications including \emph{Account Book} and \emph{Test} with Grouper. 
As described in Table 3, based on the stand alone application without data synchronization, developers can add data synchronization to these applications with Grouper by adding a small number of code. 

\subsection{Performance}

The performance goal is to avoid significantly affecting the user experience with the application developed with Grouper. 
In our performance experiments, we use the benchmark application \emph{Test} to transfer data between iPhone 4s and iPod 5 generation on a wireless LAN network (802.11n).
We installed 30 Web services on three different servers (azuma1, azuma2 and azuma3).
Each server runs a Tomcat server which includes 10 Web services.
Table 4 shows the hardware and software information of in our performance experiment.
In our benchmark application, the size of a normal message is about 620 bytes.

\begin{table}[t]

	\label{my-label}
	\begin{tabular}{llll}
		\hline
		\textbf{Device} & \textbf{CPU} & \textbf{RAM} & \textbf{OS} \\ \hline
		iPod 5 & A5 & 512MB & iOS 9.3.5 \\
		iPhone 4s & A5 & 512MB & iOS 9.3.5 \\
		azuma1 & Core i7-5820K & 32GB & Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS \\
		azuma2 & Core i7-5820K & 32GB & Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS \\
		azuma3 & Core i7-5820K & 32GB & Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To evaluate whether Grouper meets this goal, we answer the following questions:

\begin{itemize}
	\setlength{\itemsep}{1pt}
	\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
	\setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
	\item How much processing time does Grouper add to the application in data sending and receiving.
	\item How many users can an application by Grouper support.
	\item How does the number of servers $n$ and threshold ${k}$ of the secret sharing scheme influence the processing time.
\end{itemize}

To answer these questions, we design the following groups of experiments.

\subsubsection{Multiple Message}

To answer the first and second questions, we design the multiple message transportation experiment.
In this experiment, we set the secret sharing scheme to ${f(2, 3)}$.
We send multiple messages from a device and receive them in another device. 
To ensure the veracity, we send multiple message from iPod 5 generation to iPhone 4s for three time and from iPhone 4s to iPod 5 generation for three times.
We use the average value of the six groups of data as our experiment results.
In the next experiments, we also use this method to statistic the results.

Figure 5 shows the processing time of sending and receiving multiple messages.
We divide the processing time into three parts: data sync, secret sharing and network.
As the number of messages increased, data sync and secret sharing part increased linearly. 
The network part increased very slowly and sometimes decreased.
On the whole, the total processing time increased linearly.
Compared with sending messages, receiving messages cost about two times of processing time.
These experimental results show that data synchronization within a hundred messages does not influence the user experience.

With the increase of the group scale, a device must be able to handle many messages at the same time.
For example, in 100 devices in a group, each device sends an update message at the same time and then tries to synchronize messages created by others.
In this situation, each device has to receive and handle 99 messages at the same time.
Thus, a group of an application by Grouper is able to expand to 100 members.

\subsubsection{Single Message with Different Schemes}

To answer the third question, we design the single message transportation experiment with different the secret sharing scheme.
Specifically, we change the parameter ${k}$  and ${n}$ of the secret sharing scheme and test the processing time of sending and receiving a single message.
Figure 5 shows the relationship between processing time and the data set ${\left \{ \left (k, n \right )\mid 0< k < n, k=3i, n=3j+3, i, j\in\left [ 1,5 \right ]\bigcap N\right \}}$.
For sending a single message, as the parameter ${k}$ or ${n}$ increased, processing increased linearly.
However, for receiving a single message, as the parameter ${k}$ increased, processing time  changed a little, sometimes decreased.

\subsubsection{Control Variable}

We need more data to verify the result introduced above further. 
We use control variate method to design this experiment.
Figure 6a shows the relationship between processing time and ${n}$, here ${k=3}$ and ${n \in \left \{ x\mid x=3i, i \in \left [ 2, 10 \right ] \bigcap N \right \}}$. 
Figure 6b shows the relationship between processing time and ${k}$, here ${n=30}$ and ${k \in \left \{ x\mid x=3i, i \in \left [ 1, 9 \right ] \bigcap N \right \}}$. 
Here, we can answer the third question.
With the increase of ${n}$, processing time of sending and receiving increase linearly.
With the increase of ${k}$, processing time of sending increase linearly and processing of receiving does not change.
We find the reason is that the time of recovering shares by the secret sharing scheme depends only on the parameter ${n}$.

From these performance experiment, we can conclude that Grouper is able to support at least 100 members' group and at least 30 untrusted servers.

\section{Related Work}

Vanish is a system proposed by Geambasu's research group at the University of Washington. 
Vanish uses Distribute Hash Tables(DHTs) as the back-end storage.
Concretely, to protect a message, Vanish encrypts it with a random encryption key not known to the user, destroys the local copy of the key, and store shares created by a secret sharing scheme of the key in a large, public DHT.
The key in Vanish is permanently after a period of time, and the encrypted message is permanently unreadable.
Vanish is implemented with OpenDHT\cite{rhea2005opendht} or VuzeDHT\cite{vuzedht} which are controlled by a single maintainer. 
Thus, it not strongly secure due to some special P2P oriented attacks\cite{wolchok2010defeating}. 
In addition, the surviving time of the key in Vanish cannot be controlled by user. 

To address such issues in Vanish, Zeng et al. at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, propose SafeVanish and SeDas. 
SafeVanish is designed to prevent hopping attacks by extending the length range of the key shares while SeDas extends the idea of Vanish by exploiting the potentials of active storage networks, instead of the nodes in P2P, to maintain the divided secret key. By extending SeDas, Zeng's group propose CloudSky, a controllable data self-destruction system for untrusted cloud storage. 
In CloudSky, user can control the surviving time of a message.Taking advantage of ABE, user can also define the access control policy by themselves.

However, both proposals from Geambasu's group and Zeng's group are not suitable for developing a light-weight information sharing application for following reasons. 
Vanish is suitable for a mail system, because it is designed without needing to modify any of the stored or archived copies of a message and without user controllability, while messages in our target applications should be modified even if it has been sent to multiple untrusted servers.  
Although, CloudSky solves the problems about user controllability in Vanish, the encrypted message are only valuable to the user for a limited period of time.
Our target applications require data usability even user try to synchronize data after the period of time. 
A trusted authority is necessary in CloudSky to manage user profile, while we do not hope any trusted authority in our target application.

Mylar stores encrypted data on servers, and decrypts this data only in the browsers of users. 
Developers of Mylar use its API to encrypt a regular (non-encrypted) Web application. 
Mylar uses its browser extension to decrypt data on clients. 
Compared to Mylar which is using a single server, Grouper takes advantages of data redundancy provided in the secret sharing scheme.

Sweets is a decentralized social networking service (SNS) application using data synchronization with P2P connections among mobile devices. 
Sweets uses AES to encrypt user data and ABE to encrypt the keys of AES. 
However, there is an obvious problem in such a P2P approach. 
Data transfer can only be finished during two devices are online at the same time. 
Therefore, it is very troublesome for a user of our a target application if nobody is online when he want to synchronize data.
The user can synchronize data from multiple untrusted servers anytime if the application uses the proposal of Grouper.

DepSky\cite{bessani2013depsky} is a system that stores encrypted data on servers and runs application logic. 
DepSky provides a storage service that improves the availability and confidentiality by using commercial storage services. 
\emph{Cloud-of-Clouds} is the core concept in DepSky. 
It represents that DepSky is a virtual storage, and its users invoke operations in several individual severs. 
DepSky keeps encrypted data in commercial storage services and do application logic in individual servers.
In fact, DepSky is suitable for such data storage applications. 
In Grouper, untrusted servers undertake responsibility of temporarily data storage and message delivery with server-side computation.

\section{Conclusion}

This paper describes Grouper, a framework using a secret sharing scheme and multiple untrusted servers, to develop light-weight information sharing mobile applications.
In such an application, users can create a group and exchange the information safely via multiple untrusted servers.
Grouper provides two main functions: reliable data synchronization and group management for developing such applications.
Compared to self-destruction proposals introduced in related works, Grouper solves the reliable synchronization problem and ensures a member of a group can synchronize data from others even Grouper includes a self-destruction scheme.
Compared to pure data encryption proposals introduction in related works, Grouper improves dependability by using multiple untrusted servers and our new enhanced secret sharing scheme $f(k, n, r)$.

We implement Grouper's Web service in Java EE and clients in Objective-C. 
To evaluate Grouper's design, we develop applications including \emph{Account Book}, \emph{Notes} and \emph{Test} on the top of Grouper.
These applications shows that Grouper requires little developer effort to extend an stand alone application to data sharing application with synchronization.
We also evaluated the performance of Groper using our benchmark application.
The results shows that using Grouper in an application does not influence the user experience.

In the future, we will try improve the performance for data synchronizations and support more platforms .
