\begin{abstract}
	
Conventional mobile applications are built based on a client-server mode and require central servers for storing shared data and processing confidential information.
If the central servers are accessed by an attacker, a curious administrator or a government, private information will be revealed because data is often stored on the central servers in cleartext.
This paper presents Grouper, a framework for developing mobile applications without trusted central servers.
Grouper provides object synchronization among mobile devices.
Grouper uses a secret sharing scheme to create several shares from a marshalled object and uploads these shares to multiple untrusted servers. 
These untrusted servers construct a self-destruction system.
Uploaded shares will be deleted after a period of time.
Mobile devices exchange messages via untrusted servers based on the Grouper Message Protocol.
Grouper consists of a client framework and a Web service.
We have implemented the client framework for iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS in the Objective-C language.
We have implemented the Web service running on the multiple untrusted servers in the Java language.
We have implemented two applications using Grouper: an iOS application Account Book and a benchmark application Test.
We evaluate the development efforts and the performance of Grouper. 
Developing these applications shows that Grouper requires little development effort to convert an stand alone application to data sharing application.
Experimental results show that the performance of Grouper is feasible for mobile applications that are used in a small group of people.
